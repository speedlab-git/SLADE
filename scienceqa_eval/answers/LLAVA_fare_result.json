    "20788": "The expected ratio of offspring with vestigial wings to offspring with normal wings is 1:3. This is because the allele for vestigial wings (n) is recessive to the allele for normal wings (N), and when two recessive alleles are present, the phenotype is expressed, resulting in offspring with vestigial wings. Therefore, the Punnett square should show a 1:3 ratio of offspring with vestigial wings to offspring with normal wings.",

    "20815": "C. Both are chemical changes.\n\nPhotosynthesis is a chemical process in which sunlight is used to convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen. This process involves the conversion of light energy into chemical energy, which is stored in the form of glucose.\n\nTarnishing is a chemical change that occurs when a metal surface reacts with oxygen and other substances in the air to form a layer of rust or other oxides. This process involves the conversion of the metal's surface into a different chemical compound.\n\nTherefore, both photosynthesis and tarnishing are chemical changes because they involve the conversion of one substance into another through a chemical reaction.",

She was surprised to learn that the bridge remains functional even though it is literally hundreds of years old.\n\nIn this sentence, the word \"literally\" is used in its traditional sense to mean \"in a literal sense\" or \"actually.\" The sentence literally means that the Rialto Bridge in Venice is still functional despite being hundreds of years old.",

Both samples have the same number of particles.\n\nTo compare the average kinetic energies of the particles in each sample, we need to know the mass of each particle and the average particle speed. Unfortunately, the image does not provide this information.\n\nTo determine which sample has the higher temperature, we can look at the colors of the balls. In the image, the balls in sample A are green, while the balls in sample B are blue. Based on this information, we can conclude that sample B has a higher temperature, as the blue balls are typically associated with higher temperatures than the green balls.",

The text presents only two choices, \"Don't ever get a ride from Erin\" and \"her brother has been driving for only six months and he's already gotten three speeding tickets,\" when more options exist.

    "20967": "The better estimate of the temperature of a warm swimming pool is A. 25\u00b0C.\n\nThis is because the temperature of a swimming pool is typically measured in Celsius, which is the standard unit of temperature in many countries, including the United States. Therefore, it is more accurate to express the temperature of a swimming pool in Celsius rather than in Fahrenheit.\n\nB. 25\u00b0F is not a valid temperature measurement for a swimming pool, as it is expressed in Fahrenheit, which is not the standard unit of temperature in most countries.",

These factories were likely a significant source of cough drops for the company and the market, so their loss will likely have a negative impact on the availability of this product. It may take some time for Silvergrove to rebuild and restart production, which could lead to a shortage of cough drops in the market until other manufacturers can fill the gap.",

The other options, A and C, do not provide direct evidence that Peter acquired the trait of knowing how to fly a kite.",
    "20997": "Bingo's phenotype for the wool color trait is A. black wool.\n\nSince Bingo has two alleles for black wool (Bingo has the genotype \"Bingo\" and the allele \"l\"), this means that Bingo will express the black wool phenotype. In this scenario, the dominant allele is \"L\" for white wool, so the recessive allele \"l\" will be expressed in the presence of two alleles for black wool.",

Dave went on to calculus after studying trigonometry, but he never fully comprehended it.\n\nThe pronoun reference in this sentence is vague because it refers to \"it\" without providing any context or clarification about what \"it\" refers to. The sentence could be referring to calculus or trigonometry, but it is not clear from the sentence itself which one it is referring to.",

Glass, on the other hand, is a flexible and pliable material that can be stretched to some extent. However, the extent to which a glass bowl can stretch depends on its thickness, shape, and the force applied to it.\n\nIn contrast, nylon shorts are made from a woven or knitted fabric that is designed to provide some stretch and comfort. However, the stretchability of nylon shorts is generally limited compared to a glass bowl, especially when it comes to stretching the shorts to a significant extent without causing them to tear or lose their shape.",

Since all other forces on Kimi are assumed to be balanced, the net force on Kimi is zero. This means that Kimi is in a state of equilibrium, where she is neither accelerating nor decelerating.",

In the case of baking cookies, the cookies change from a solid to a soft, gooey state as the heat causes the sugar to dissolve and the fat to melt. Similarly, rust forms on a metal gate as a result of a chemical reaction between the metal and oxygen, but the end result is a physical change in the appearance and structure of the metal.",
    "21147": "The logical fallacy used in the text is false causation, also known as causality fallacy. The argument suggests that because good students will study the material regardless of whether there is a test, and bad students won't study the material even for a test, therefore giving tests is not necessary. However, this argument assumes that the lack of studying for a test causes a lack of knowledge retention, which is not necessarily true. It is possible that students may study the material for the test but not retain it for the long term, or they may not study for the test but retain the material through other means. Therefore, the argument fails to establish a causal relationship between giving tests and student learning outcomes.",
